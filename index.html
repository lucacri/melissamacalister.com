                I'm a Maine native, transplanted to NYC where I live, work, and
                play.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm the kind of person who arrives at my gate at the airport an
                hour early because I can't stand being late. I tend to make a
                plan for everything and then at least two or three backups - but
                have learned to find joy in improvising as well. I live by my
                Google calendar and find deep satisfaction in checking items off
                my Evernote checklists.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started my career in corporate ad sales, but for the past
                several years have worked at high-growth tech startups, where
                I've helped create systems and processes that instill a method
                into the madness. I do my best work when I can function
                cross-departmentally, communicating across business groups to
                keep everyone marching to the beat of the same drum and
                generally making sure important stuff gets done. Throughout my
                career I've also leaned heavily into strategic business
                development and partnerships, focusing on creating relationships
                that drive mutual value vs. trying to force square pegs into
                round holes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I enjoy a good barre or yoga class, and am an
                avid reader (I read 100 books in 2016!). On a Sunday afternoon,
                you can find me in Central Park with my husband and our Yorkie
                and Maltese pups, followed by attempting a new recipe I saw on
                Food Network (with varying degrees of success).

                        In my professional career, I've been fortunate to work with some of the best. From early stage
                        startups to the world’s largest company, I’ve honed a skillset that allows me to be effective in
                        a wide range of roles. I’ve worked on projects ranging from helping lead a company-wide
                        rebranding effort to building out a marketplace partner acquisition strategy and closing $1M in
                        new business in a year. Executive leadership often has referred to me as an organizational Swiss
                        Army knife, and I make it a point to become what Seth Godin would call a “Linchpin” in any
                        organization I join.
